        <p class="leftside">
            The history of Zaandam is a captivating story filled with stories of industrial revolution and a crucial role in the Dutch Golden Age.
        </p>
        <h3>The Dutch golden age</h3>
        <p class="leftside">
            The founding of the Dutch Golden Age, saw Zaandam play a remarkable role as one of the oldest industrial centres in Western Europe. With a crowded trade scene, the city boasted an impressive six hundred windmills simultaneously in operation, marking an era of prosperity and innovation.
       </p>
       <h3>Industrial revolution</h3>
       <p class="leftside">
        In the 18th century, Zaandam continued to shine during the Dutch Golden Age, constantly evolving and revolutionizing the milling industry, which propelled industrialization throughout the region. The reason behind this transformation was none other than the Dutch East India Company, also known as the VOC. It was the VOC's trade and industry that boosted Zaandam's growth and progress.

       <h3>19th and 20th century</h3>
       <p class="leftside">
        Innovation persisted into the 19th and 20th centuries, boosting Zaandam to fame in the world of cacao and chocolate production. One notable example is Verkade, a major player in the chocolate and cookies industry, which originated in Zaandam.

       <h3>Present</h3>
       <p class="leftside">
        Today, Zaandam stands as a modern, vibrant city, offering a wide variety of activities while retaining its historic charm, thanks in large part to the preservation of the Zaanse Schans. Situated as a neighbor to Amsterdam, Zaandam continues to welcome visitors from all corners of the globe. These tourists often explore the Zaanse Schans Museum, admire the iconic windmills, and enjoy the city's diverse shopping opportunities.
